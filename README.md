# Cursnake

This is a simple snake game implemented with curses to play in the terminal emulator.

To play, simply get the code, run `make` or compile the `snake.c` with your favorite compiler
and run `make play` or just run the binary directly.

This was just a simple fun project to get to know the curses library.

Have fun :).
